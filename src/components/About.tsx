        Hello, my name is Barrett Ruth. I am a second-year student at the
        University of Virginia, majoring in Computer Science, Economics, and
        Statistics. Over the next few years, I will be seeking internships and
        jobs at the intersection of these three disciplines, from financial
        modeling to software engineering.
      </p>

        Consequently, I will be extensively practicing on platforms like
        LeetCode, HackerRank, and TopCoder to enhance my algorithmic thinking.
        The effectiveness of these platforms as metrics for an individual's
        thought process is debatable, but one thing is certainâ€”they often
        receive unjust criticism.

        This editorial serves as both a problem-solving guide and a record of my
        progress.

        I do not consider myself especially talented in data structures and
        algorithms. However, I believe that people often overcomplicate
        problems. Through this editorial, I aim to offer alternative
        perspectives and new insights to facilitate easier, quicker, and more
        effective learning.
