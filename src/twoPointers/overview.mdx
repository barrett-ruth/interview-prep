# Technique Overview

## What is Two Pointers?

The [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide) defines the two pointers technique as:

> Iterating two monotonic pointers across an array to search for a pair of indices satisfying some condition in linear time.

However, after improving my skills with this technique, I have come to realize that even a definition as intentionally abstract and vague as this doesn't fully capture its essence.

In reality, the two pointers technique:

- Does not necessarily search for indices
- <Ref
    id={1}
    description={
      <Fragment>
        <a
          href='https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/editorial/'
          target='_blank'
        >
          Linked list cycles
        </a>{' '}
        can be detected with two pointers
      </Fragment>
    }
  >
    Can be applied to a variety of data structures (arrays, linked lists,
    strings, binary trees)
  </Ref>
- Uses values associated with the specific pointers (unlike a sliding window)
- Moves each pointer in a single direction

Vague, right? However, the advantage of defining a technique so broadly is that it can be applied to a vast array of problems.

These few constraints open up numerous ways the technique can be adapted, including:

- Pointer speed (fast or slow?)
- <Ref
    id={2}
    description={
      <Fragment>
        Finding{' '}
        <a
          href='https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/editorial/'
          target='_blank'
        >
          subarray sums equal to k
        </a>{' '}
        uses two monotonically increasing pointers.
      </Fragment>
    }
  >
    Pointer direction (forward or backward? both or one?)
  </Ref>
- Pointer collision (stop before or after the pointers overlap?)

It is also crucial to consider whether the two pointers approach can even be applied. When I think I can use two pointers, I ask myself the following questions about the problem I am solving:

- Does it _actually make sense_ to traverse the input monotonically?
  - If so, how should I preprocess the data?
- Once I process an index/value, can I safely update my pointers and move on?
- Given the parameter constraints, is a two pointers solution practical?
  - What is the time complexity of this approach?

Like most concepts, identifying and creating a two pointers solution becomes much easier after solving a few problems. Let's dive into an example.

Ensure you understand both the intuition behind the solution and the answers to the aforementioned questions. Solving more problems will help you accustomize you to recognizing and solving two pointers problems. This includes picking up on queues in problem statements, common pre-processing techniques, and other optimization techniques.
